# 🚢 Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This repository contains my internship project analyzing the **Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster** dataset from Kaggle.  
The goal of this task was to explore, clean, and visualize the dataset to uncover insights into survival patterns.

---

## 📌 Project Overview
The **Titanic dataset** is a classic dataset in data science, containing information about passengers such as:
- Demographics (age, gender, class, etc.)
- Ticket and cabin information
- Survival outcome

Through data cleaning, statistical summaries, and visualizations, this project identifies factors that influenced survival.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- **Python**
- **Pandas** (data handling)
- **NumPy** (numerical operations)
- **Seaborn** (statistical plots)
- **Matplotlib** (visualizations)

## 📊 Key Steps

### 1. Data Cleaning
- Handled missing values (`Age`, `Embarked`, `Cabin`).
- Converted categorical variables (e.g., `Sex`, `Embarked`) into usable forms.
- Checked and corrected data types.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis
- Generated descriptive statistics.
- Group-based insights:
  - Survival by gender
  - Survival by passenger class
  - Age distribution of survivors vs non-survivors
- Cross-tabulations of survival by multiple factors.

### 3. Data Visualization
- Bar plots: Survival rates by gender and class.
- Histograms: Age and fare distributions.
- Correlation heatmap: Showed relationships between numerical variables and survival.
- Heatmaps and grouped bar plots for deeper survival insights.

## 🔥 Bonus Visualizations
- Heatmap of survival rates by **Gender & Class**.
- Correlation heatmap summarizing feature relationships.
